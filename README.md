# Cryptocurrency Investments | Social and Technical Analysis

## Problem Identification

Cryptocurrency coins are digital assets designed to work as a medium of exchange where ownership records are transactions are stored in a blockchain ledger using strong cryptography. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency formed in 2009 and dominants the market with $903.5B market capitalization as of October 2021.

The goal of this project is to utilize technical analysis and social media metrics to identify buy, hold and sell opportunities for short-term holding periods. For this project to limit the scope of the analysis, I will be focusing on Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
